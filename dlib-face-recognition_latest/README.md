# dlib-face-recognition-android
Recognize faces in android using dlib state-of-the-art face recognition model based on deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.13% on the LFW benchmark.

## App
Face recognition is very accurate but it takes approximately 6 seconds on a Redmi4 with Snapdragon 435 and Android 7.1.

## Usage
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/gv22ga/dlib-face-recognition-android.git
Now you can directly open the `dlib-face-recognition-app` in android studio

## Build JNI (Optional)
First get the required libraries
    
    ./envsetup

To build native code and copy to android studio's project manually
    
    cd [dlib-face-recognition-android]
    ndk-build -j 2
    cp -r libs/* dlib-face-recognition-app/dlib/src/main/jniLibs
Please see [dlib-android](https://github.com/tzutalin/dlib-android) for more details

## Dlib 19.9
This project uses dlib 19.9. Due to some c++11 issues, I had problem compiling dlib 19.9 with opencv. So I made some small changes in `dlib/dlib/serialize.h`, `dlib/dlib/dnn/layers.h`, `dlib/dlib/geometry/rectangle.h`, `dlib/dlib/image_transforms/interpolation.h`, `dlib/dlib/dnn/loss.h`, `dlib/dlib/statistics/running_gradient.h` and `dlib/dlib/global_optimization/global_function_search.cpp` files in dlib library.

## Sample code
```java
// recognize person
FaceRec mFaceRec = new FaceRec(Constants.getDLibDirectoryPath());
List<VisionDetRet> results = mFaceRec.recognize(image_bitmap);
for(VisionDetRet n:results) {
    Log.d(TAG, n.getLabel()); // prints the name of recognized person
}

// add person
// add the person image to dlib_rec_example/images directory with name `[PersonName].jpg`
mFaceRec.train()
```

## Image Quality
You can change the parameters `INPUT_SIZE` in `MainActivity.java` and `MAX_IMAGE_SIZE` in `AddPerson.java` if recognition is not working accurately.

## Todos
This app currently uses [HOG based face detector](http://dlib.net/dnn_introduction_ex.cpp.html). This detector fails to detect small faces and is not very accurate. Instead we can use [CNN based face detector](http://dlib.net/dnn_mmod_face_detection_ex.cpp.html), which is very accurate but will take much more time.
